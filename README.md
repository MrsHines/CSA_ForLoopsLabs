# For Loop Labs

## Program #1: 
- Complete the method loopSum(start, stop).  
- Given two parameters, loopSum will total the values from start up to and including stop.  It should return the sum.

## Program #2:
- Complete the method countOdds(start, stop)/
- Given two parameters, countOdds will return the number of odd values between start and stop (inclusive).


## Program #3:
- Complete methods isCoolNum( n ) && countCoolNumbers( n ).  
- isCoolNum( n) will determine if a number is a cool number.  A cool number is any number that has a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, 4, 5, and 6. 
- countCoolNumbers will count the number of cool numbers between 6 and the parameter passed in.

## Program #4:
- Complete the factorial(n) method. 
- factorial(n) will take an integer as a parameter and return the factorial of that integer


## Program #5
- Complete the isPrime(n) method.
- isPrime(n) will take an integer and return a boolean value that indicates if the number is prime (true) or composite (false)

## Program #6
- Complete the gcd(num1, num2) method.
- gcd(num1, num2) will take two integers as parameters and return an integer that is the greatest common divisor of the two numbers (the largest number that will evenly divide into both numbers)
- HINT: Math.min(a,b) will return the smallest value of a and b
